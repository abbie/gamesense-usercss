# gamesense-usercss

**How to use**:
* Install [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) or another style extension of your choosing which supports [UserCSS](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/UserCSS).
* Visit [this page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abbie/gamesense-usercss/main/gamesense.user.css) to install the latest version.

**Known issues**:
* Subscription time remaining and extend subscription options are not visible as I gave up before finding a nice way to add them.
